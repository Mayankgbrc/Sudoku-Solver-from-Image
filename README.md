# Sudoku-Solver-from-Image
This project implements a Sudoku solver that can recognize and solve a Sudoku puzzle from an input image. It uses Computer Vision techniques to extract the puzzle from the image, applies Optical Character Recognition to identify the digits, and then solves the puzzle using an algorithm. The solution is then displayed in the form of an image.
